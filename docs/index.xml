      <description>My Projects Below are a few of my projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve made during my studies or on my free time. Most of these are pure passion projects which I have made because I have wanted to learn some tool, technology or I have wanted test implementing some algorithm.
Battleship Game (with hunting algorithm) A game of battleship agains AI using hunting algorithm. The game is made in Python is modular in a sense that players can be used to do another things like playing completely another game by creating an interface for the player!</description>

      <description>Soft Skills I&amp;rsquo;m generally quite outwards person and I like to converse with people. I would say that my strong suit is learning new things and helping others to learn the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way.
What I would like to improve is my time management. In 2023, I want to incorporate the usage of calendar (yes, calendar ðŸ“…) to my workflow to manage time and resources.
Overall, I have enjoyed working with people in daily basis but I also appreciate the quietness that comes along the profession called software developer.</description>
