# My Projects

Below are a few of my projects that I've made during my studies
or on my free time. Most of these are pure passion projects which
I have made because I have wanted to learn some tool, technology or I have
wanted test implementing some algorithm.

## Battleship Game (with hunting algorithm)

A game of battleship agains AI using hunting algorithm. The game is
made in Python is modular in a sense that players can be used to do another
things like playing completely another game by creating an interface for the player!

## Wish â€“ Shell written in pure C

Wish was made as a course project for university. It has few built-in
tools like `cd` and `exit`. It is also capable searching executables from `PATH`
and adding directories to `PATH`

## RSynth â€“ Thesis work in Rust & WASM

RSynth is part of my B.C thesis work. In my thesis I research
if WASM [^1] can be used speed up audio processing in browser locally. RSynth
is used to research the possibilites and downfalls of using WASM.
