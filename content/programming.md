# Programming Skills

My programming skills are already quite versatile and I'm always ready to learn more.

Most used languages are:

- Python
- TypeScript
- Rust
- C

I'm the most familiar with following techs:

- MySQL/MariaDB
- ElasticSearch
- Express.js
- Selenium (with Python)
- AWS

Currently learning/using:

- WebAssembly (My thesis researches using WASM to process audio ðŸŽµ)
- Rust (This language feels like the future's C)
- Hugo CMS[^1] (This web site was made with Hugo ðŸ˜‰)
