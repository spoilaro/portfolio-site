# Soft Skills

I'm generally quite outwards person and I like to converse with people.
I would say that my strong suit is learning new things and helping others to
learn the things I've learned along the way.

What I would like to improve is my time management. In 2023, I want to
incorporate the usage of calendar (yes, calendar ðŸ“…) to my workflow to manage time and resources.

Overall, I have enjoyed working with people in daily basis but I also appreciate
the quietness that comes along the profession called software developer. I think myself
as someone who is very self driven and is able to accomplish a lot by myself.
